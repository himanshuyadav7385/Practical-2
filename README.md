As a result of our analysis, we will provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

### Business Understanding to Data Problem Definition
**Business Problem:** Identifying key drivers for used car prices to guide inventory decisions for a used car dealership.

**Data Problem Definition:** The task is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the price of used cars based on their attributes. This involves analyzing historical data to identify which features (like make, model, year, mileage, condition) most significantly impact the selling price. The model needs to be robust, interpretable, and capable of handling large-scale data to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
