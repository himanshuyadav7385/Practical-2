## **OVERVIEW**

In this assignment we will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of our analysis, we will provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

### CRISP-DM Framework

To frame the task, throughout our practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.

### Business Understanding to Data Problem Definition
**Business Problem:** Identifying key drivers for used car prices to guide inventory decisions for a used car dealership.

**Data Problem Definition:** The task is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the price of used cars based on their attributes. This involves analyzing historical data to identify which features (like make, model, year, mileage, condition) most significantly impact the selling price. The model needs to be robust, interpretable, and capable of handling large-scale data to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

### Data Understanding

**Available features**
- id: A unique identifier for the car.
- region: The region in which the car is being sold.
- price: The selling price of the car (our target variable).
- year: The year the car was manufactured.
- manufacturer: The make of the car.
- model: The model of the car.
- condition: The condition of the car (like new, used, etc.).
- cylinders: The number of cylinders in the carâ€™s engine.
- fuel: The type of fuel the car uses.
- odometer: The mileage of the car.
- title_status: The legal status of the car (clean, salvage, etc.).
- transmission: The type of transmission (automatic, manual).
- VIN: The Vehicle Identification Number.
- drive: The type of drive (FWD, RWD, AWD).
- size: The size category of the car.
- type: The body type of the car.
- paint_color: The color of the car.
- state: The state in which the car is being sold.

### **After studying the data it was concluded that it would be best to create a model per vehicle type as prices significantly vary based on type of vehicle and they cannot be judged on same scale.**

 ### Data Preparation
 Next step is to prepare the data for modelling. Following actions were taken during data preparation steps.
